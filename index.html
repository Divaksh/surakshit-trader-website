            <h2>Welcome to Surakshit Trader!</h2>
                <p>I am Divaksh Jain, a seasoned trader and the visionary behind this initiative, dedicated to empowering safe and informed trading through <u>education</u>. My journey began with my startup venture, Loot Deals, aiming to help people save money by discovering the best deals on products, following the principle that "Saving a Rupee is Earning a Rupee." Loot Deals managed to save lakhs of rupees for thousands of people around the world.</p>
                <p>In 2017, I entered the stock market with the same mindset of finding and grabbing the best deals on stocks. Through years of extensive research, discipline, and consistency, I became a full-time profitable trader in 2021. Since then, I haven’t had a single month close negatively. This philosophy of "A Rupee Saved is a Rupee Earned" has been the cornerstone of my approach to trading. My expertise lies in generating substantial returns while protecting capital, embodying the essence of "Surakshit Trader."</p>
