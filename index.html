            <h2>About Me: Divaksh Jain - The Surakshit Trader</h2>
            <p>Welcome to Surakshit Trader! I am Divaksh Jain, and my journey in the world of trading is rooted in a deep passion for securing the best value and empowering individuals to achieve financial success. My initial venture, Loot Deals, focused on saving money for thousands of people by grabbing the best deals. This philosophy of "A Rupee Saved is a Rupee Earned" has been the cornerstone of my approach to trading.</p>
            <p>In 2017, I transitioned into the stock market with the same mindset of finding and securing the best deals. Through years of extensive research, discipline, and consistency, I became a profitable trader in 2021. Since then, I haven’t had a single month close negatively. My expertise lies in generating substantial returns while protecting capital, embodying the essence of "Surakshit Trader."</p>
